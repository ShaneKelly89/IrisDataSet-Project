# IrisDataSet-Project
This is the repository created for the project within PANDS Module 2021. The following statement is the problem statement for the project, as per the breif.\
'This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set [3]. You must research the data set
and write documentation and code (in Python [1]) to investigate it. An online search for
information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it
previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that
are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.
You might do that for this project as follows:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
• outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
• saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
• outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
It might help to suppose that your manager has asked you to investigate the data set, with a
view to explaining it to your colleagues. Imagine that you are to give a presentation on the
data set in a few weeks’ time, where you explain what investigating a data set entails and how
Python can be used to do it. You have not been asked to create a deck of presentation slides,
but rather to present your code and its output to them.'

# Task Preperation 

For the purpose of this task, the author first created a 'Project Planner' which was used to help guide and manage this project. This planner will have undergone a number of changes through the process of the  project, but will be a constant point of reference throughout. 

Plan for the Project: 

1. Create a repository to be used for the project.
2. Carry out background research on the IRIS Dataset, and write up a concise summary. 
3. Create the appropriate folders to store the required information and data (update and create as the project goes on).
4. Monitor References: Create a word doc to store references throughout the project. Add to Readme near the end.
5. Download the IRIS Dataset.
6. Breakdown the tasks within the project in relation to the investigation of the dataset. Examine the research question, and create a plan on how I intend to investigate the dataset and produce the required outputs.
7. Spent time researching and revising appropriately and wisely. 
8. Make regular and appropriate commits throughout. 

# Background Information 
The Iris Dataset is a multivariate dataset that contains 4 features of 50 samples of three species of the Irish flower, namely _setosa_, _virginica_, and _versicolor_. The 4 features within the dataset are:
1. Lenght of sepal in cm.
2. Width of sepal in cm.
3. Lenght of petal in cm.
4. Width of petal in cm.

The dataset was first introduced by British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1963 paper '_The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems_', which is available to read at <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x> [1].
The dataset is was introduced as an example of linear discriminant analysis, which refers to 'a method used to find a linear combination of features that characterise or separate two or more classes of objects or events' [2]. As such, based on the combination of the four features mentioned above, Fisher developed a linear discrimination model which was able to distinguish between the three species of Iris. A snapshot of Fisher's original data can be viewed below.\
