This is the repository created for the project within PANDS Module 2021.

# Task Preperation 

For the purpose of this task, the author first created a 'Project Planner' which was used to help guide and manage this project. This planner will have undergone a number of changes through the process of the  project, but will be a constant point of reference throughout. 

Plan for the Project: 

1. Create a repository to be used for the project.
2. Carry out background research on the IRIS Dataset, and write up a concise summary. 
3. Create the appropriate folders to store the required information and data (update and create as the project goes on).
4. Monitor References: Create a word doc to store references throughout the project. Add to Readme near the end.
5. Download the IRIS Dataset.
6. Breakdown the tasks within the project in relation to the investigation of the dataset. Examine the research question, and create a plan on how I intend to investigate the dataset and produce the required outputs.
7. Spent time researching and revising appropriately and wisely. 
8. Make regular and appropriate commits throughout.
